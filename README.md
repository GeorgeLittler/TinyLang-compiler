# TinyLang Compiler

**TinyLang** is a minimal interpreted programming language designed and implemented from scratch in Python.

This project includes:
- A **manual lexer** (character-by-character tokeniser)
- A **recursive descent parser** that builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- An **interpreter** that executes the AST with variables, expressions, conditionals, and loops

âœ… Arithmetic expressions (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)  
âœ… Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`)  
âœ… Control flow: `if`, `else`, `while`  
âœ… Print statements (`print(x);`)

## ðŸ§ª Example TinyLang Program

```tiny
let x = 5 + 3;
print(x);

let count = 0;
while (count < 3) {
    print(count);
    count = count + 1;
}
